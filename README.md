# conflict-modelling
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of conflicts or civil unrest in a specific region or country. By analyzing historical data and various socio-economic, political, and demographic factors, the model aims to provide early warning indicators and insights that can help policymakers and organizations proactively address potential conflicts.
